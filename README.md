# Ludum Dare #42: RoboCoup

This game was made for the game jam Ludum Dare #42 (theme: *running out of space*)
Itâ€™s the robot revolution and they want to exterminate all the humans on Earth because of surpopulation and legal measures taken against the robots related to it. You are one of these robot agents. Goal of the game: identify all the humans in the building and kill them.

*Note: the game is quite violent but I wanted to experiment, in an artistic way, this dark vision of human progress, and what oppression and division into groups can lead into. And, huh, also surpopulation is not sci-fi, that's a real problem.*
